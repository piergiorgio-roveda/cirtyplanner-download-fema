### ✅ **Why You Can Share It**

FEMA's flood maps and data, including **Flood Risk Products (FRM, FRR, FRD)**, are:

* **Public domain**
* **Produced by a U.S. federal agency (FEMA)**
* **Freely available for public use and redistribution**

There is **no copyright or license restriction** that prohibits redistribution. FEMA even encourages communities and developers to use, adapt, and distribute these datasets to increase awareness and preparedness.

### 📄 Official Statement (from FEMA Data Use Policy):

> “All data disseminated by FEMA are considered public information and may be distributed freely, with appropriate citation.”

This means you're **legally allowed** to:

* Download bulk data (even by scripting if necessary)
* Rehost it on GitHub, Google Drive, or a community portal
* Package it for easier local access
* Add tools, visualizations, or instructions

---

### 📌 Best Practices When Sharing:

To make your distribution more transparent and compliant:

1. **Include a README**
   Add a simple `README.md` or text file explaining:

   * The source: “Original data provided by FEMA Map Service Center ([https://msc.fema.gov/portal/home)”](https://msc.fema.gov/portal/home%29”)
   * A disclaimer: “This is a community mirror for easier access. Always refer to FEMA for authoritative updates.”

2. **Don’t modify original data** (unless clearly marked)
   If you clean, rename, or restructure files, offer both the **raw/original zip files** and a separate processed folder.

3. **Avoid charging money**
   Since it’s public data, you can’t sell it—but you can accept donations or sponsorships for your time.

### 🚀 Tip: Automate Bulk Download

Since MSC doesn’t provide bulk links, you might consider writing a Python script using FEMA’s [`MSCDownload`](https://github.com/FEMA/MSCDownload) tool or scraping the product IDs via their community search.

### ✅ Summary

* ✅ **Yes**, you can redistribute on GitHub or Google Drive.
* 🛡️ Just cite FEMA as the source and include a small disclaimer.
* 🔄 Keep the original format or clearly label your changes.
