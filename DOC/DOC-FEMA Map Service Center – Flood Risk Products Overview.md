# FEMA Map Service Center – Flood Risk Products Overview

**Flood Risk Products (FRP)** are non‐regulatory flood mapping resources provided through FEMA’s Map Service Center (MSC) that supplement the official **Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs)** and Flood Insurance Studies. These products are part of FEMA’s Risk MAP program and are geared towards communicating flood risk information in a user-friendly way, rather than meeting National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) statutory requirements. In contrast to regulatory products (which determine insurance and compliance), Flood Risk Products help communities **visualize and understand local flood risks**, supporting better planning and mitigation decisions. There are **three main types of Flood Risk Products** available on the MSC (depending on the study conducted for a community):

* **Flood Risk Map (FRM)** – a graphical flood risk overview map
* **Flood Risk Report (FRR)** – a detailed narrative flood risk report
* **Flood Risk Database (FRD)** – a digital database of flood risk data

These products are provided free of charge via FEMA’s MSC website. Below we describe each product type, including its purpose, content, format, and how it can be accessed or used (especially with GIS tools, where applicable).

## Flood Risk Map (FRM)

The **Flood Risk Map (FRM)** is a **visual flood risk map** that provides a geographic overview of flood hazards and risk in the project area. It is typically a large-format map (often at watershed or community scale) illustrating key flood risk information derived from a FEMA Risk MAP study. **Intended Use:** The FRM is designed as a public-friendly communication tool – it highlights the most important flood risk data in an accessible graphic format. Community officials and the public can use the FRM to quickly visualize areas of notable flood risk, such as flood-prone zones, depth or elevation variations, and other risk indicators, without needing GIS software.

**Description & Content:** The FRM is **non-regulatory** (it’s not used for official NFIP determinations) and is an *optional* product produced as part of a Risk MAP project. It typically depicts flood hazard extents (like the 1% annual-chance floodplain and other flood zones) and may include additional risk information or annotations. For example, an FRM might use color-coding or symbols to show areas of deeper flooding, changes from previous flood maps, or **Areas of Mitigation Interest** (locations that could benefit from flood mitigation actions). The FRM is often created using standardized cartographic templates provided by FEMA to ensure clear symbology (e.g. standardized legends, callouts, and color schemes). FEMA’s guidance allows flexibility in layout or even digital alternatives – in some cases, interactive story maps or web maps can be used to convey the same information as the static FRM. However, the most common format is a static map.

**Format & Access:** FRMs are usually delivered as **PDF map documents** (sized for large-format printing) or similar image files. They can be **downloaded from the FEMA MSC** by searching for a community and looking under “Flood Risk Map” in the Search All Products results. Once downloaded, an FRM PDF can be printed or viewed on-screen. While an FRM is not a dynamic GIS layer, it is based on underlying GIS data from the Flood Risk Database. Thus, it serves as a ready-made map for community outreach – for example, officials might include an FRM graphic in public meetings or reports to **illustrate flood risk hotspots and communicate changes** since the last map revision. Because it’s a static map, direct GIS integration is limited (the FRM itself isn’t meant to be loaded as data into GIS), but the underlying data **are** available in the FRD if further analysis or custom mapping is needed.

## Flood Risk Report (FRR)

The **Flood Risk Report (FRR)** is a **comprehensive narrative report** that summarizes flood hazards and risk data for the project area. It provides detailed information about local flood risk to help **local officials, floodplain managers, planners, and emergency managers** (as well as citizens) better understand their flood risks and potential mitigation strategies. By design, the FRR is written in **non-technical language** so that it’s accessible to a broad audience, translating the technical findings of the flood study into practical insights for the community.

**Description & Content:** The FRR typically covers the entire flood study area (often a watershed or county) **as well as individual communities** within that area. This dual scope highlights that flood risk often spans multiple jurisdictions. The report will usually begin with an overview of the watershed’s flood risk and then provide community-by-community sections. Key contents often include:

* **Summary of Flood Hazards:** A description of the flood sources and areas studied, including any new or updated floodplain mapping.
* **Changes Since Last FIRM:** An overview of how the new flood hazards differ from the previous effective maps (e.g. areas where the floodplain expanded or contracted), often supported by data from the FRD.
* **Flood Risk Data and Analysis:** This may include tables or maps of population and structures at risk, critical infrastructure in flood zones, and statistical summaries of risk (for example, counts of buildings in the 1% annual-chance floodplain, estimated damages, etc.). The FRR often incorporates results of any **Flood Risk Assessment** (which could be a Hazus analysis or other loss estimate) for the community – helping quantify potential impacts in dollar losses or other metrics.
* **Areas of Mitigation Interest:** Identification of specific areas or sites that could benefit from mitigation projects (repetitive loss areas, vulnerable critical facilities, or areas with significant flood depth increases, for instance).
* **Community NFIP Statistics:** Some reports include each community’s National Flood Insurance Program statistics (number of policies, past claims, etc.) to provide context on historical flood impacts and insurance coverage.
* **Risk Reduction Recommendations:** General guidance or next steps for communities, such as mitigation planning tips, outreach suggestions, or references to relevant programs.

The FRR is tailored to the specific flood risk project – it will include the sections and datasets that are relevant to that study (and omit those that don’t apply). All the data presented (for example, tables of structures at risk or maps of changes) are derived from the **Flood Risk Database** that accompanies the study. By consolidating this information, the FRR serves as a **single reference document on local flood risk** for community leaders and stakeholders.

**Format & Access:** The Flood Risk Report is provided as a **PDF document** (FEMA delivers it as a digitally generated PDF with interactive table of contents and bookmarks for easy navigation). It can be downloaded from the MSC by searching for the community and looking under “Flood Risk Reports” in the product results. Once downloaded, officials can share the PDF with community members or use it in planning meetings. While the FRR itself is not a GIS dataset, it often references data that can be explored in GIS (via the FRD). For example, if the FRR states that 200 buildings are in a newly added flood zone, the geospatial details of those buildings/areas are in the FRD. The FRR is thus a **companion explanatory document** to the maps and data – it does not require special software to use, and it’s meant to be broadly accessible for communication and planning purposes.

## Flood Risk Database (FRD)

The **Flood Risk Database (FRD)** is the **digital collection of flood risk data** produced by a Risk MAP study. It is the cornerstone of the Flood Risk Products – the FRD stores all the detailed information and datasets that underlie the Flood Risk Map and Report. In essence, the FRD is a **GIS database** containing geospatial layers, tables, and supporting files that represent the flood risk findings for the project area. FEMA uses a standardized schema for the FRD so that data are stored consistently and can be easily distributed and used.

**Description & Content:** The FRD provides a **comprehensive, machine-readable set of flood risk datasets** for the project. It typically includes:

* **Changes Since Last FIRM (CSLF) Dataset:** A layer showing where the new 1% annual-chance floodplain has expanded or contracted compared to the previous flood map. This helps identify areas with **newly added or removed flood risk**. It often includes attributes quantifying changes (e.g., increase or decrease in flood depths or extents).
* **Flood Depth Grids:** Raster data indicating flood **depth** (water depth above ground) across the floodplain for key flood scenarios (commonly for the 1% annual-chance event, and sometimes the 0.2% event). Depth grids enable users to see how deep the water is likely to be at any location in the floodplain.
* **Water Surface Elevation (WSEL) Grids:** Raster datasets representing the **elevation of flood waters** (typically the water surface elevation during the 1% flood, relative to a vertical datum). These allow a user to click on a map and obtain the flood water elevation at that point, supporting quick estimation of Base Flood Elevations in areas between cross-sections.
* **Flood Risk Assessment data:** Results of any quantitative risk assessment performed. For example, if a Hazus flood loss analysis was done, the FRD may include tables or spatial data summarizing potential economic losses, population impacts, or other risk metrics by sub-area (like by census block or neighborhood).
* **Areas of Mitigation Interest (AoMI):** A dataset marking locations that are notable for mitigation planning. These could be areas that experienced notable flooding outside mapped zones, clusters of repetitive flood loss properties, undersized drainage structures, or other problem areas identified during the study. Each AoMI typically has a brief description of the issue or suggested mitigation measures.
* **Other supporting datasets:** Depending on the scope of the project, the FRD may also contain additional layers – for example, **percent-annual-chance grids** (or a \*\*“Percent 30-Year Chance” grid) showing the probability of flooding over a 30-year period for each location, levee or dam breach analysis data if those were studied, or **metadata tables** and look-up tables that provide context for the spatial layers. The FRD also includes base data (like the project area boundary and community boundaries) and documentation about the data sources.

*(Together, these components represent the “flood risk datasets” produced by the study. FEMA’s documentation notes that the primary flood risk datasets in an FRD usually include the **Changes Since Last FIRM, Depth and Water Surface Elevation rasters, Flood Risk Assessment results, and Areas of Mitigation Interest**.)*

Importantly, the **FRD is the only required Flood Risk Product** out of the three – FEMA always produces the FRD for a Risk MAP project, whereas the FRM and FRR are optional outputs. The FRD’s contents serve as the data source for generating the FRM and FRR for those who need them. In other words, the FRD is a **data repository** capturing the full scope of flood risk information, which the map and report then visualize or summarize.

**Format & GIS Integration:** The Flood Risk Database is delivered in **GIS-compatible formats**. Typically, FEMA will provide the FRD as an **Esri file geodatabase** (a consolidated GIS database format) or as a collection of GIS files (shapefiles, raster grids, etc.) packaged in a ZIP file. Because it’s in GIS format, users can **open the FRD in standard GIS software** (such as ArcGIS or QGIS) to explore and analyze the data. For example, a planner or GIS analyst can load the depth grid to see how flood depths vary across the community, overlay it with local building footprints to determine which structures might experience deep flooding, or use the changes layer to identify newly high-risk areas. FEMA actively encourages communities to make use of these data; they’ve even developed **technical “recipe cards” with step-by-step instructions for GIS professionals on how to combine local data with Flood Risk Product datasets to create useful mitigation planning tools**. (For non-GIS users, FEMA also provides non-technical guides describing the uses of these products.)

The FRD’s GIS data can be adapted into other formats as needed. For instance, a community could request or derive **KML** files from the FRD layers to view them in Google Earth. The key point is that the FRD makes the flood risk information *flexibly accessible* for various applications. It is often used in local **hazard mitigation planning** – e.g. to integrate into a community’s GIS systems, to support risk assessments in mitigation plans, or to guide land-use decisions by highlighting areas of highest risk. The data in the FRD are considered advisory (non-regulatory) and do **not** replace official FIRM data for insurance or enforcement, but they provide a richer picture of risk that communities can use for proactive planning.

**Accessing the FRD:** You can obtain a community’s Flood Risk Database via the FEMA MSC. Using the “Search All Products” tool for a given jurisdiction will list any available Flood Risk Database under a “Flood Risk Database” section, usually with a Product ID and download link (often a ZIP file). These files can be quite large given the detailed grids and datasets inside. Once downloaded, users will need GIS software to open and make full use of the data. FEMA’s documentation (and regional contacts) can assist with understanding the schema and contents of the FRD if needed.

## Access and Integration Summary

All of the Flood Risk Products – the FRM, FRR, and FRD – are **available through FEMA’s Map Service Center** website. To find them for a particular community or project, users can go to the MSC’s **“Search All Products”** page and enter the location of interest. If that area has Flood Risk Products, the search results will include separate entries (and download links) for **Flood Risk Maps, Flood Risk Reports,** and **Flood Risk Database** files (note that availability varies; not every community will have these products – they are typically present only if a Risk MAP study has been completed for that area). All downloads on the MSC are free.

In summary, FEMA’s Flood Risk Products provide an **enhanced understanding of flood hazards and risks** beyond the static lines on a regulatory flood map. The **Flood Risk Map** offers a high-level visual of where risk is greatest, the **Flood Risk Report** provides narrative context and detailed community-specific insights, and the **Flood Risk Database** delivers the raw data that can be leveraged in GIS systems and planning efforts. Together, these resources empower local officials, planners, and the public to **better assess their flood risk and take informed actions** to reduce potential flood damage. They are meant to be used in tandem with official FIRMs – not for regulatory purposes, but to facilitate **communication, planning, and mitigation** in the ongoing effort to build safer, flood-resilient communities.
