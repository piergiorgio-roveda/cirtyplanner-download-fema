A comprehensive Python toolkit for collecting and analyzing FEMA flood risk shapefile data across all US states, counties, and communities.

## Overview

This project provides automated tools to:
- Extract state, county, and community data from FEMA's portal
- Collect flood risk shapefile information for all jurisdictions
- Download all available shapefile ZIP files
- Extract and merge shapefiles into consolidated GPKG files by state and type
- Store data in a structured SQLite database for analysis
- Generate comprehensive reports and statistics

## Project Status

| Component | Status | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Scripts 01-03 | Complete | State, county, and community data extraction |
| Script 04 | Complete | Flood risk shapefile metadata collection |
| Script 05 | Complete | Shapefile download functionality |
| Script 06 | Complete | Legacy extraction and merging implementation |
| Scripts 06a-06d | Complete | Modern four-step processing pipeline |

The project is actively collecting flood risk shapefile metadata from FEMA's portal, with successful data collection from hundreds of counties across multiple states.

## Documentation

The project documentation is organized in the `DOC` folder:

- [Project Structure](DOC/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md) - Detailed view of the project organization
- [Usage Guide](DOC/USAGE.md) - Instructions for running the scripts
- [Configuration](DOC/CONFIGURATION.md) - Configuration options and settings
- [Database Schema](DOC/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md) - Database structure and tables
- [Processing Pipeline](DOC/PROCESSING.md) - Download and processing functionality

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

**Network Requirements:**
- VPN connection to USA may be required for accessing FEMA portal
- Stable internet connection for large data downloads

**Python Dependencies:**
```bash
pip install requests sqlite3 geopandas fiona shapely pyproj psutil
```

## Data Analysis Examples

### SQL Queries

```sql
-- Count shapefiles by state
SELECT s.state_name, COUNT(*) as shapefile_count 
FROM shapefiles sf 
JOIN states s ON sf.state_code = s.state_code 
GROUP BY s.state_name 
ORDER BY shapefile_count DESC;

-- Find largest shapefiles
SELECT product_name, product_file_size, product_file_path 
FROM shapefiles 
WHERE product_file_size LIKE '%MB' 
ORDER BY CAST(REPLACE(product_file_size, 'MB', '') AS INTEGER) DESC;
```

### Python Analysis

```python
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd

# Connect to database
conn = sqlite3.connect('meta_results/flood_risk_shapefiles.db')

# Load data into pandas
df = pd.read_sql_query("""
    SELECT s.state_name, c.county_name, cm.community_name, 
           sf.product_name, sf.product_file_size
    FROM shapefiles sf
    JOIN states s ON sf.state_code = s.state_code
    JOIN counties c ON sf.county_code = c.county_code
    JOIN communities cm ON sf.community_code = cm.community_code
""", conn)

# Analyze data
print(df.groupby('state_name').size().sort_values(ascending=False))
```

## API Integration

The scripts interact with FEMA's portal using:
- **Base URL**: `https://msc.fema.gov/portal/advanceSearch`
- **Method**: POST with form data
- **Rate Limiting**: 0.1-second delays between requests

```python
# Form Data Structure
{
    'utf8': 'âœ“',
    'affiliate': 'fema',
    'selstate': '01',        # State code
    'selcounty': '01001',    # County code  
    'selcommunity': '01001C', # Community code
    'method': 'search'
}
```
